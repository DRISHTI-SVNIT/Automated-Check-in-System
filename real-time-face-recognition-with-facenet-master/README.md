# real-time-face-recognition-with-facenet
This project aims to detect the face of the persons in real time from stored database using facenet with tensorflow library 
# How it Works?
1.Copy all the train images in 'images' folder.
2.Then run 'align_create_classifier.py' which will first align the input images and then create a classifier named 'classifier' 
3.After classifier is created run 'real_time_detection.py' file and then the face of the person is recognised.
