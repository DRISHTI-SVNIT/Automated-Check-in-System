# real-time-face-recognition-with-facenet
This project aims to detect the face of the persons using facenet with tensorflow library.<br>
The project includes improved image cropping and alignment using Multi-Task Cascaded Convolution Neural Network. In this project a 128-dimensional embedding based on triplet loss and deep CNN is used for classification. We have achieved an accuracy of 89%.<br>
The project is implemented in Python.<br>
The working video of the model is also in this repository with the file named as "Video of Facenet".<br>
The working video of our model from facenet is
